#An attempt at a platformer

Trying to make a simple platformer engine/game along the lines of Mario

[Try it](http://nicmendoza.github.io/small-platformer)

##Instructions:
Use W,S,D or LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT arrow keys to move, SPACE to jump, and SHIFT to use pickups.

##Ideas/To-Dos

- todo: moving platforms
- todo: artwork (top edges for platforms, repeating textures)
- todo: ladders (?)
- todo: wall jumping (?)
- todo: figure out better way for objects to inherit methods
- todo: try foreground objects (blurred?)
- todo: path-following enemies
- todo: move to requireJS for module-loading
- todo: look up quad trees for storing static level data
